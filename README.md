# Reel.ly

### GA WDI DC April 2014, Project 3

### Overview

**Reel.ly** is an application for ranking your top 10 movies via head to head matchups, simultaneously constructing a watchlist of movies you haven't seen. GigHub was developed as the third and final Rails individual project for the April 2014 Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly DC. It was developed over a five day sprint to model the agile software development process.

### User Stories Completed

* As a user, I want to select one of the movies in the matchup to either add to my rankings or update my rankings.
* As a user, I want to be able to select "haven"t seen" so the movie is replaced with another option and it gets added to my watchlist.
* As a user, I want to see a splash screen so that I can register or log in to the site.
* As a user, I want visual feedback on my selections so I feel rewarded.
* As a user, I want to see a constantly updating list of my top 10 so I can see the results of my choices.
* As a user, I want to see a constantly updating list of movies I haven't seen so I can remember to watch them later!
